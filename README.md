# COVIDdata

Yet another python package for accessing COVID-19 data. Sorry. I have opinions and I don't like all the others.

This package provides methods for fetching various COVID-19 related data sources. Results are provided as [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) datasets, with consistent variable naming and attribution data included.

## Installation

I'm not going to clutter PyPI up with yet another COVID package. Just do `pip install git+https://github.com/russs/coviddata#egg=coviddata`.

## Usage

Check out the [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/russss/coviddata/blob/master/README.ipynb).
